# Proptuna Refactoring Plan: Next.js to React + Express with i18n

This document outlines our detailed plan for refactoring the Proptuna application from Next.js to a standard React + Express architecture while adding internationalization (i18n) support. We'll maintain all existing functionality while improving code organization and maintainability.

## Current Progress (March 21, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Set up `/client` directory with Vite for React frontend
- Set up `/server` directory with Express backend
- Configure hot reloading for both client and server
- Set up single command to start both client and server
- Configure CORS to allow client-server communication
- Set up basic API endpoints for properties with mock data
- Configure AI controller for conversation management
- **Set up i18n infrastructure**:
  - Created i18n configuration with direct imports of translation files
  - Implemented I18nProvider component for language state management
  - Created LanguageSelector component for switching languages
  - Added translation files for common, sidebar, ai, and properties namespaces
  - Created utility components for translations (TranslatedText)
  - Added date and number formatting utilities for i18n

### üîÑ In Progress
- Porting the UI layout structure from the original app
- Implementing sidebar component with i18n support
- Setting up routing with React Router

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps
- Add theme control (light/dark mode)
- Continue porting UI components one by one
- Implement feature-specific pages (AI, Properties, People, Documents)

## Project Structure Overview

The refactored application has a clear separation between client and server:

### Client (`/client`)
- React application built with Vite
- Uses React Router for routing
- Implements i18n with react-i18next
- Organized by feature with shared components

### Server (`/server`)
- Express application
- RESTful API endpoints
- Controllers for different features
- Database integration with Supabase

## Core Application Understanding

Proptuna is an AI-powered property management platform with the following key features:

- **AI Chat Interface**: Handles property communication, maintenance issues, and general inquiries
- **Property Management**: Tracks properties, their details, and associations
- **Document Management**: Stores and organizes property-related documents
- **People Management**: Manages tenants, owners, and their contact information
- **AI Conversations Management**: Tracks conversations and related tasks

The application uses Supabase as its database with tables for properties, people, documents, jobs, tasks, conversations, and various association tables.

## Refactoring Approach

We're taking an **incremental approach** to this refactoring:

1. Focus on getting the minimum app running first
2. Add components back one by one from the old codebase
3. Ensure each component works properly before moving to the next
4. Take things one step at a time rather than trying to do everything at once

## Original Component Structure Analysis

### Layout System
- `src/app/layout.tsx`: Main layout component that:
  - Imports global CSS
  - Sets up the basic HTML structure
  - Includes the Sidebar component
  - Wraps the main content area
  - Adds Vercel Analytics

### Navigation System
- `src/app/(components)/sidebar.tsx`: Complex sidebar component that:
  - Uses Next.js Link component for navigation
  - Provides a responsive navigation interface
  - Includes user profile dropdown
  - Uses Lucide icons for visual elements
  - Implements active state styling for current route

### Styling System
- `src/app/globals.css`: Contains:
  - Tailwind directives
  - CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode)
  - Custom styling for markdown content
  - Base styles for the application

### Routing System
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Simple redirect to the AI page
  - Uses Next.js router for navigation
  - Shows a loading spinner during redirect

### Server Controllers
- `server/src/controllers/ai.controller.ts`: Handles AI-related functionality:
  - Manages conversations
  - Processes AI requests
  - Integrates with LLM services
  - Uses a prompt template system

- `server/src/controllers/document.controller.ts`: Handles document management:
  - CRUD operations for documents
  - Document tagging functionality
  - Integration with Supabase

### API Routes
- `server/src/routes/document.routes.ts`: Sets up document-related endpoints:
  - Document CRUD operations
  - Tag management endpoints

## Key Features to Preserve

- **AI Assistant**: Interactive chat interface that can answer questions about properties and create maintenance tasks
- **AI Conversations Management**: Tracks past AI interactions with properties, people, and maintenance tasks
- **Property Management**: Tracks properties, their details, and associations with tenants and documents
- **Document Management**: Stores and organizes property-related documents with tagging and association capabilities
- **People Management**: Manages tenants, owners, and their contact information

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Architecture Change**: Convert from Next.js to React + Express
2. **Internationalization**: Add multi-language support throughout the application
3. **Code Organization**: Break down large components into smaller, more manageable pieces
4. **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure all existing features continue to work
5. **Vercel Deployment**: Ensure the refactored application can be deployed to Vercel

## 1. Internationalization (i18n) Implementation
