# People Management System Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Existing People Page
The application already has a `/people-page` component with basic functionality:
- Card-based UI for displaying people
- Simple search functionality
- Add person dialog
- Mock data with hardcoded people

### Database Schema
The database schema includes:
- `Person` entity with basic fields (id, organization_id, name)
- `Contact` entity for storing contact information (email, phone, etc.)
- Relationships between people, properties, and organizations

### Document Management System (Reference)
The document management system includes:
- AG Grid for tabular display
- CRUD operations via API
- Filtering and search functionality
- Success/error messaging
- Modal dialogs for actions

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Backend API Layer

#### Create People API Client (`/src/lib/people.ts`)
- [ ] Define core API interfaces and types
- [ ] Implement server-side functions for fetching people
- [ ] Add pagination support using sequence_id approach

#### Create People Client (`/src/lib/people-client.ts`)
- [ ] Implement client-side functions for CRUD operations:
  - [ ] `fetchPeople()` - Get list of people with filtering
  - [ ] `fetchPersonById()` - Get single person
  - [ ] `createPerson()` - Create new person
  - [ ] `updatePerson()` - Update existing person
  - [ ] `deletePerson()` - Delete person
  - [ ] Association functions (with properties, groups)

### 2. Enhance Existing People Page

#### Update People Page (`/src/app/people-page/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Replace mock data with real API calls
- [ ] Implement loading states
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Implement success messaging
- [ ] Enhance filtering capabilities
- [ ] Update UI to match document management style

#### Create AG Grid Component (`/src/app/(components)/people-ag-grid.tsx`)
- [ ] Create AG Grid implementation for people
- [ ] Define column definitions
- [ ] Implement cell renderers
- [ ] Add action buttons (edit, delete)
- [ ] Implement filtering and sorting

### 3. Create Person Detail Pages

#### Person Detail View (`/src/app/people/[id]/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Create detail view for individual person
- [ ] Show associated properties and groups
- [ ] Display contact information
- [ ] Add edit functionality

#### Person Creation Form (`/src/app/people/create/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Implement form for creating new people
- [ ] Add validation
- [ ] Handle form submission

### 4. Integration Points

#### Navigation
- [ ] Ensure proper navigation between pages
- [ ] Add links from people to associated properties/groups

#### Cross-Entity Relationships
- [ ] Implement UI for managing associations
- [ ] Show people in property details
- [ ] Show properties in person details

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core API Layer
Focus on creating the backend API client and ensuring data can be fetched and manipulated.

### Phase 2: AG Grid Implementation
Implement the AG Grid component for displaying people in a tabular format, similar to documents.

### Phase 3: Enhanced UI
Update the existing people page to use the new AG Grid component and API layer.

### Phase 4: Detail Pages
Create the detail and creation pages for individual people.

## Design Considerations

### UI Consistency
- Maintain consistent styling with the document management system
- Use the same patterns for success/error messaging
- Follow the same layout structure

### Performance
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use client-side filtering for better user experience
- Optimize data fetching with proper caching

### User Experience
- Provide clear feedback for actions
- Ensure smooth transitions between pages
- Make associations between entities clear and intuitive
